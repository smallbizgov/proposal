2025 Convocatoria for Community Dissemination Information and Proposal Idea A successful application to any funding opportunity begins with a deep and nuanced analysis of the call for proposals, moving beyond its surface-level requirements to understand the funder's core philosophy and strategic intent. The 2025 "Divulgación Comunitaria de la Ciencia y las Humanidades" call from the Secretaría de Ciencia, Humanidades, Tecnología e Innovación (Secihti) is no exception. A thorough deconstruction of the Convocatoria reveals a clear vision for a specific type of project-one that is interdisciplinary, community-centered, and committed to social and environmental justice.

**Core Mandate and Financial Framework**

The explicit parameters of the Convocatoria establish the foundational rules for any potential project. These non-negotiable elements define the scope, scale, and administrative requirements that all proposals must meet.

• **Objective:** The primary goal is to "promote community dissemination (divulgación comunitaria) of Science and Humanities." This is not merely an academic exercise; the stated intention is to contribute directly to the exercise of the human right to science, foster scientific and humanistic vocations, and, most critically, enhance the "integral well-being of populations in conditions of vulnerability". This triple objective requires proposals to demonstrate impact across educational, vocational, and social welfare domains.

• **Project Type:** The call is highly focused, supporting only one category of project: "Interdisciplinary projects for community dissemination of Science and Humanities". This singular focus underscores that interdisciplinarity is not an optional add-on but the fundamental organizing principle of any fundable project. Proposals must convincingly integrate methodologies and perspectives from both the sciences and the humanities.

• **Funding Structure:** A two-stage financial model is mandated, spanning the fiscal years 2025 and 2026\. Stage 1 (2025) provides a maximum of $200,000.00 MXN, while Stage 2 (2026) offers a substantially larger maximum of $1,000,000.00 MXN, for a total potential award of $1,200,000.00 MXN. This back-loaded funding structure is a clear signal that the Secihti expects a phased approach. The initial, smaller grant is intended for planning, partnership development, baseline assessment, and pilot activities. The subsequent, larger grant is for the full-scale implementation and expansion of a successfully piloted model. Proposals must therefore present a logical and realistic two-year work plan that reflects this phased reality.

• **Key Dates and Eligibility:** The timeline is firm, with a final deadline for application submission on August 1, 2025\. Results will be published starting August 25, 2025\. Eligibility is intentionally broad, welcoming applications from public and private higher education institutions, research centers, community-based organizations, civil society organizations (CSOs), and even individuals such as artists and journalists. However, a critical administrative prerequisite is that all applicants must be registered in the • Rizoma platform within the National Information System on Humanities, Sciences, Technologies, and Innovation before the deadline.

**Proposal: "Puentes de Bienestar: Humanidades y Salud Digital para Comunidades Migrantes" (Bridges of Well-being: Humanities and Digital Health for Migrant Communities)**

• **Narrative:** Migrants and refugees arriving in Mexicali are in a state of crisis-disoriented, often traumatized, and disconnected from sources of reliable health information. Language barriers, cultural differences, and a deep-seated mistrust of authorities make traditional health outreach efforts difficult and often ineffective. This project proposes an innovative, human-centered solution. It will create a multilingual, mobile-first digital platform that leverages the power of storytelling (the humanities) to deliver critical, culturally competent health information (the sciences). By centering the voices and experiences of migrants themselves, this project will build a crucial bridge of trust and deliver vital knowledge directly into the hands of those who need it most.

• **Target Community:** Migrant and refugee individuals and families residing in Mexicali's network of shelters. The project will specifically address the needs of the most prominent linguistic groups, including Spanish speakers from Mexico and Central America, and Haitian Creole speakers, who form a significant part of the migrant population.

• **Interdisciplinary Approach:**

• **Science:** This stream draws from public health, digital health (UX/UI design), and epidemiology. The project will begin with a rapid needs assessment to identify the most pressing health concerns within the migrant population, such as dehydration, foot care, women's reproductive health, mental health first aid, and navigating the local health system. The team will then design and build an accessible, low-bandwidth, icon-driven digital platform (a web app) to deliver evidence-based, actionable health information.

• **Humanities:** This stream draws from narrative medicine, translation studies, and communication theory. The platform's content will not be clinical factsheets. Its core will be a library of testimonios: short, powerful video and audio stories from fellow migrants who share their own experiences of successfully navigating a specific health issue in Mexicali. This peer-to-peer, narrative-based approach is proven to be more engaging, memorable, and trust-building than institutional messaging. All content will be professionally translated and culturally adapted for each target language group.

• **Activities:**

• **Stage 1 (2025 \- Co-design and Piloting, $200,000.00 MXN):** 1\. Establish formal partnerships with the key migrant shelters in Mexicali (e.g., Cobina, Refugio). 2\. Conduct needs-assessment focus groups with diverse groups of migrants to prioritize health topics and understand their information-seeking behaviors. 3\. Co-design the user interface and functionality of the digital platform with input from migrant users. Develop a working prototype. 4\. Identify, interview, and produce the first set of 10-12 narrative health messages (testimonios) in Spanish and Haitian Creole.

• **Stage 2 (2026 \- Implementation and Scaling, $1,000,000.00 MXN):** 1\. Launch the full, public version of the "Puentes de Bienestar" platform and work with shelter staff to promote its use among new arrivals. 2\. Conduct a formal evaluation of the platform's reach, usability, and impact on users' health knowledge and self-reported health behaviors. 3\. Expand the platform by adding more health topics and languages (e.g., relevant indigenous languages from southern Mexico or Central America) based on user feedback. 4\. Develop and implement a sustainability plan to train shelter staff and community health workers to manage and update the platform, ensuring its long-term utility.

**Expected Impact:** This project will directly improve the health literacy and self-care capacity of thousands of migrants passing through Mexicali. It will provide a valuable tool to reduce the burden on overstretched shelter staff. It will create a scalable and innovative model for digital public health outreach that can be adapted for other transient and multicultural populations. Finally, it will create a unique and powerful archive of migrant health narratives, a humanistic resource that gives voice to a community too often rendered voiceless.

**Strategic Synthesis and Path to a Winning Proposal**

The five project proposals detailed above are not merely a collection of disparate ideas. They represent a cohesive, strategic portfolio designed to address the complex socio-environmental challenges of Mexicali in a manner that is deeply aligned with the vision and requirements of the Secihti Convocatoria. Each project is grounded in documented local needs, built upon robust interdisciplinary and participatory methodologies, and structured for tangible, measurable impact.

**A Portfolio of Integrated Solutions**

Together, these five projects form a comprehensive response to the multifaceted nature of vulnerability in Mexicali. "Voces del Aire" tackles urban environmental justice in the colonias. "Cosechando Salud" addresses the occupational health crisis in the rural agricultural valley. "El Río que Nos Une" confronts a signature binational pollution problem through the lens of youth engagement and historical memory. "Cucapá: Resiliencia" centers the rights and knowledge of the region's most historically marginalized indigenous community. And "Puentes de Bienestar" offers an innovative, technology-driven solution for the acute needs of transient migrant populations. This portfolio approach demonstrates a holistic understanding of the region, showing that the applicant is prepared to engage with the full spectrum of challenges, from urban to rural, from environmental to social, from historical to contemporary.

**Maximizing Impact through Strategic Alignment**

The ultimate strength of this portfolio lies in its meticulous alignment with every key criterion of the Convocatoria. Each project:

• Focuses on a specific, highly vulnerable community identified in the regional analysis. • Is fundamentally interdisciplinary, braiding together scientific and humanistic methods not as an afterthought, but as its core operational logic. • Employs a participatory, co-creative methodology (CBPR, Citizen Science, Diálogo de Saberes), directly responding to the funder's call for a "horizontal production of knowledge." • Follows the two-stage funding model, with a clear plan for piloting and scaling. • Aims for concrete social impact, moving beyond simple dissemination to foster empowerment, health, justice, and resilience.
